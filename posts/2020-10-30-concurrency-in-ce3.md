Cats Effect 3 is just around the corner! The library has seen several major 
changes between 2.0 and 3.0, so in an effort to highlight those changes, we
will be releasing a series of blog posts covering a range of topics. If you 
would like to see a blog post about a particular subject, don't hesitate to 
reach out! You can try out early Cats Effect 3 releases 
[here](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/releases).

### Introduction
In this post, we offer a broad overview of the concurrency model that serves 
as the foundation for Cats Effect and its abstractions. We discuss what fibers
are and how to interact with them. We also talk about how to leverage the 
concurrency model to build powerful concurrent state machines. Example programs 
are written in terms of `cats.effect.IO`.

Before going any further, let's briefly review what concurrency is, how it's
useful, and why it's tedious to work with. 

### Concurrency
Concurrent programming is about designing programs in which multiple logical
threads of control are executing at the same time. There is a bit to unpack 
in this definition: what are logical threads and what does it mean for them to 
execute "at the same time?"

A logical thread is merely a description of a sequence of discrete actions. 
An action is one of the most primitive operations that can be expressed in 
the host language.

In programs that are written in traditional high-level languages like Java or 
C++, these logical threads are typically represented by native threads that 
are managed by the operating system. The actions that comprise these threads 
are native processor instructions or VM bytecode instructions. In programs that
are written with Cats Effect, these logical threads are represented by fibers, 
and the actions that comprise them are `IO` values.

What does it mean for logical threads to execute at the same time? Because the 
actions of a logical thread are discrete, the actions of many logical threads 
can be interleaved into one or more streams of actions. This interleaving is 
largely influenced by external factors such as scheduler preemption and I/O 
operations, so it is usually nondeterministic. More specifically, in the 
absence of synchronization, there is no guarantee that the actions of distinct 
logical threads occur in some particular order.

Another common perspective is that concurrency generates a partial order among
all the actions of all the logical threads in a program. Actions _within_ a 
logical thread are ordered consistently with program order. Actions _between_ 
multiple logical threads are not ordered in the absence of synchronization.

#### Concurrency is useful
Concurrency is a tool for designing high-performance applications that are 
responsive and resilient. These applications typically involve multiple 
interactions or tasks that must happen at the same time. For example, a 
computer game needs to listen for keyboard input, play sound effects, and run 
game loop logic, all while rendering graphics to the screen. A multiplayer game 
must also communicate with a network server to exchange game state information.

Traditional sequential programming models quickly become inadequate when 
applied to building these kinds of responsive programs. The computer game 
program must perform all of the tasks described above at the same time; it 
wouldn't be a very good game if we couldn't respond to player input while 
playing a sound! Concurrency enables us to structure our program so that 
each interaction is confined to its own logical thread(s), all of which 
execute at the same time.

Concurrency complements modular program design. Interactions like graphics
rendering and network communication are largely unrelated; it would be tedious
and messy to design a program that constantly switches between graphics and
audio I/O operations. Instead of having one complex thread that performs 
every interaction, we can confine each interaction to its own logical thread. 
This allows us to think about and code each interaction independently of each 
other while having the assurance that they occur at the same time. The 
modularity that concurrency affords makes for programs that are much easier to 
understand, maintain, and evolve.

#### Concurrency is hard
Concurrency is notoriously cumbersome to work with. This is no surprise to any
developer that has worked with threads and locks in any mainstream programming
language. Once we start dealing with concurrency, we have to deal with a slew
concerns: deadlocks, starvation, race conditions, thread leaks, thread blocking
and so on. A bug in any one of these concerns can have devastating consequences
in terms of correctness and performance.

The most popular method for achieving concurrency in Scala is with `Future`,
which enables the evaluation of asynchronous operations. However, it is plainly
insufficient for those of us who practice strict functional programming. 
Furthermore, `Future` doesn't expose first-class features like cancellation, 
finalization, or synchronization that are crucial for building safe concurrent
applications.

Akka actors are another common way to achieve concurrency in Scala. For similar
reasons as `Future`, they are also insufficient in strict functional 
programming, however, one could certainly build a pure actor library on top of 
the Cats Effect's concurrency model.

### Cats Effect Concurrency
Cats Effect takes the perspective that concurrency is a necessary technique 
for building useful applications, but existing tools for achieving concurrency 
in Scala are tedious to work with. A goal of Cats Effect is then to provide
library authors and application developers a concurrency model that is safe and
simple to work with.

Most users should never directly interact with the concurrency model of Cats
Effect because it is a low-level API. This is intentional: low-level 
concurrency constructs are inherently unsafe and effectful, so forcing users 
to touch it would only be a burden for them. Cats Effect and other libraries 
provide higher-level and safer abstractions that users can exploit to achieve 
concurrency without having to understand what's happening under the hood.
For example, http4s achieves concurrency on requests by spawning a fiber for 
every request it receives; users need only specify the request handling code 
that is eventually run inside the fiber.

That being said, it can be tremendously helpful to learn about Cats Effect's
internals and concurrency model to understand how our applications behave and
how to tune them, so let's jump into it.

### Fibers
Cats Effect chooses fibers as the foundation for its concurrency model. The 
main benefit of fibers is that they are conceptually similar to native threads: 
both are types of logical threads that describe a sequence of computations. 
Unlike native threads, fibers are not associated with any system resources. 
They coexist and are scheduled completely within the userspace process, 
independently of the operating system. This mode of concurrency reaps major 
benefits for users and performance:

1. Fibers are incredibly cheap in terms of memory overhead so we can create 
hundreds of thousands of them without thrashing the process. This means that we
also don't need to pool fibers; we just create a new one whenever we need it.
2. Context switching between fibers is orders of magnitude faster than context
switching between threads.
3. Blocking a fiber doesn't necessarily block a native thread; this is called
semantic blocking. This is particularly true for nonblocking I/O and other
asynchronous operations.

Concretely, a fiber is a logical thread that encapsulates the execution of an 
`IO[A]` program, which is a sequence of `IO` effects (actions) that are bound 
together via `flatMap`. Fibers are logical threads, so they can run 
concurrently.

The active execution of some fiber of an effect `IO[A]` is represented by the 
type `FiberIO[A]`. The execution of a `FiberIO[A]` terminates with one of three 
possible outcomes, which are encoded by the datatype `OutcomeIO[A]`:

1. `Succeeded`: indicates success with a value of type `A`
2. `Errored`: indicates failure with a value of type `Throwable`
3. `Canceled`: indicates abnormal termination via cancellation

Additionally, a fiber may never produce an outcome, in which case it is said to 
be nonterminating.

Cats Effect exposes several functions for interacting with fibers directly.
We'll explore parts of this API in the following sections. Again, fibers are
considered to be an unsafe and low-level feature and must be given more caution 
than we offer in the examples. Users are encouraged to use the higher-level 
concurrency constructs that Cats Effect provides.

#### Starting and joining fibers
The most basic action of concurrency in Cats Effect is to start or spawn a new
fiber. This requests to the scheduler to begin the concurrent execution of a
program `IO[A]` inside a new logical thread. The actions of the current fiber
and the spawned fiber are interleaved in a nondeterministic fashion.

After a fiber is `start`ed, it can be `join`ed which semantically blocks the
joiner until the joinee has terminated, after which `join` will return the 
outcome of the joinee. Let's take a look at an example.

Let's take a look at an example that demonstrates spawning and joining of 
fibers, as well as the nondeterministic interleaving of their executions.

```tut:silent
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}
import cats.syntax.all._

object ExampleOne extends IOApp.Simple {
  def repeat(letter: String): IO[Unit] =
    IO.print(letter).replicateA(100).void

  override def run: IO[Unit] =
    for {
      fa <- (repeat("A") *> repeat("B")).as("foo!").start
      fb <- (repeat("C") *> repeat("D")).as("bar!").start
      // joinAndEmbedNever is a variant of join that asserts
      // the fiber has an outcome of Succeeded and returns the
      // associated value.
      ra <- fa.joinAndEmbedNever
      rb <- fb.joinAndEmbedNever
      _ <- IO.println(s"\ndone: a says: $ra, b says: $rb")
    } yield ()
}
```

In this program, the main fiber spawns two fibers, one which prints `A` 100 
times and `B` 100 times, and another which prints `C` 100 times and `D` 100 
times. It then joins on both fibers, awaiting their termination. Here is one 
possible output from an execution of the program:

```
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACAACACACACACACACACACACACAACACAAACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACACCACACACACACACACACACACACACCCCCBBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBCBBBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDDBDBDBDBDBDBDBDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
done: a says: foo!, b says: bar!
```

We can observe that there is no consistent ordering between the effects of
separate fibers; it is completely nondeterministic! However, the effects
_within_ a given fiber are always sequentially consistent, as dictated by 
program order; `A` is never printed after `B`, and `C` is never printed
after `D`. This is how `join` imposes an ordering on the execution of the 
fibers: the main fiber will only ever print the `done:` message after the 
two spawned fibers have completed.

It is recommended to use the safer `IO.background` instead of `IO.start` for 
spawning fibers.

#### Canceling fibers
A fiber can be canceled after its execution begins with the `FiberIO#cancel`
function. This semantically blocks the current fiber until the target fiber 
has finalized and terminated, and then returns. Let's take a look at an 
example.

```tut:silent
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}
import cats.syntax.all._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

object ExampleTwo extends IOApp.Simple {
  override def run: IO[Unit] =
    for {
      fiber <- IO.println("hello!").foreverM.start
      _ <- IO.sleep(5.seconds)
      _ <- fiber.cancel
    } yield ()
}
```

In this program, the main fiber spawns a second fiber that continuously prints
`hello!`. After 5 seconds, the main fiber cancels the second fiber and then the
program exits.

Cats Effect's concurrency model and cancellation model interact very closely 
with each other, however, the latter is out of scope for this post. It will be 
discussed in detail in a future post, but in the meantime, visit the Scaladoc 
pages for `MonadCancel` and `GenSpawn`.

#### Racing fibers
Cats Effect exposes several utility functions for racing `IO` actions (or their
fibers) against eachother. Let's take a look at some of them:

```scala
object IO {
  def racePair[A, B](left: IO[A], right: IO[B]): IO[Either[(OutcomeIO[A], FiberIO[B]), (FiberIO[A], OutcomeIO[B])]]
  // higher-level functions
  def race[A, B](left: IO[A], right: IO[B]): IO[Either[A, B]]
  def both[A, B](left: IO[A], right: IO[B]): IO[(A, B)]
}
```

`racePair` races two fiber and returns the outcome of the winner along with a 
`FiberIO` handle to the loser. `race` races two fibers and returns the 
successful outcome of the winner after canceling the loser. `both` races two 
fibers and returns the successful outcome of both (in other words, it runs both
fibers concurrently and waits for both of them to complete).

`racePair` seems a bit hairy to work with, so let's try an example out with 
`race`:

```tut:silent
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}
import cats.syntax.all._

object ExampleThree extends IOApp.Simple {
  def factorial(n: Long): Long =
    if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)

  override def run: IO[Unit] =
    for {
      res <- IO.race(IO(factorial(20)), IO(factorial(20)))
      _ <- res.fold(
        a => IO.println(s"Left hand side won: $a"), 
        b => IO.println(s"Right hand side won: $b")
      )
    } yield ()
}
```

In this program, we're racing two fibers, both of which calculate the 20th 
factorial. Running this program with many iterations demonstrates that either 
fiber can win.

### Communication
We have seen how fibers can directly communicate with each other via `start`, 
`join`, and `cancel`. These mechanisms enable bidirectional communication, 
but only at the beginning and end of a fiber's lifetime. It's natural to ask 
if there are other ways in which fibers can communicate, particularly during 
their lifetime. 

Shared memory is an alternative means by which fibers can indirectly 
communicate and synchronize with each other. Cats Effect exposes two primitive 
concurrent data structures that leverage shared memory: `Ref` and `Deferred`.

#### `Ref`
`Ref` is a concurrent data structure that represents a mutable variable. It 
is used to hold state that can be safely accessed and modified by many
contending fibers. Let's take a look at its basic API:

```scala
trait Ref[A] {
  def get: IO[A]
  def set(a: A): IO[Unit]
  def update(f: A => A): IO[Unit]
}
```

`get` reads and returns the current value of the `Ref`. `set` sets the current 
value of the `Ref`. `update` atomically reads and sets the current value of the 
`Ref`. Let's take a look at an example.

```tut:silent
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}
import cats.syntax.all._

object ExampleFour extends IOApp.Simple {
  override def run: IO[Unit] =
    for {
      state <- IO.ref(0)
      fibers <- state.update(_ + 1).start.replicateA(100)
      _ <- fibers.traverse(_.join).void
      value <- state.get
      _ <- IO.println(s"The final value is: $value")
    } yield ()
}
```

In this program, the main fiber starts 100 fibers, each of which attempts to
concurrently update the state by atomically incrementing its value. Next, the
main fiber joins on each spawned fiber one after the other, waiting for 
their collective completion. Finally, after the spawned fibers are complete,
the main fiber retrieves the final value of the state. The program should
produce the following output:

```
The final value is: 100
```

#### `Deferred`
`Deferred` is a concurrent data structure that represents a condition variable.
It is used to semantically block fibers until some arbitrary condition has been 
fulfilled. Let's take a look at its basic API:

```scala
trait Deferred[A] {
  def complete(a: A): IO[Unit]
  def get: IO[A]
}
```

`get` blocks all calling fibers until the `Deferred` has been completed with a
value, after which it will return that value. `complete` completes the 
`Deferred`, unblocking all waiters. A `Deferred` can not be completed more than
once. Let's take a look at an example.

```tut:silent
import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}
import cats.effect.kernel.Deferred
import cats.syntax.all._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

object ExampleFive extends IOApp.Simple {
  def countdown(n: Int, pause: Int, waiter: Deferred[IO, Unit]): IO[Unit] = 
    IO.println(n) *> IO.defer {
      if (n == 0) IO.unit
      else if (n == pause) IO.println("paused...") *> waiter.get *> countdown(n - 1, pause, waiter)
      else countdown(n - 1, pause, waiter)
    } 

  override def run: IO[Unit] =
    for {
      waiter <- IO.deferred[Unit]
      f <- countdown(10, 5, waiter).start
      _ <- IO.sleep(5.seconds)
      _ <- waiter.complete(())
      _ <- f.join
      _ <- IO.println("blast off!")
    } yield ()
}
```

In this program, the main fiber spawns a fiber that initiates a countdown. When
the countdown reaches 5, it waits on a `Deferred` which is completed 5 seconds
later by the main fiber. The main fiber then waits for the countdown to 
complete before exiting. The program should produce the following output:

```
10
9
8
7
6
5
paused...
4
3
2
1
0
blast off!
```

#### Building a concurrent state machine
`Ref` and `Deferred` are often composed together to build more powerful and
more complex concurrent data structures. Most of the concurrent data types in 
the `std` module in Cats Effect are implemented in terms of `Ref` and/or 
`Deferred`. Example include `Semaphore`, `Queue`, and `Hotswap`.

In our next example, we create simple concurrent data structure called `Latch` 
that is blocks a waiter until a certain number of internal latches have been 
released. Here is the interface for `Latch`:

```tut:silent
trait Latch {
  def release: IO[Unit]
  def await: IO[Unit]
}
```

Next, we need to define the state machine for `Latch`. We can be in two
possible states. The first state reflects that the `Latch` is still active
and is waiting for more releases. We need to track how many latches are still
remaining, as well as a `Deferred` that is used to block new waiters. The 
second state reflects that the `Latch` has been completely released and will no
longer block waiters.

```tut:silent
sealed trait State
final case class Awaiting(latches: Int, waiter: Deferred[IO, Unit]) extends State
case object Done extends State
```

We can implement the `Latch` interface now. We create a `Ref` that holds our 
state machine, and then a `Deferred` that block waiters. The initial state of 
a `Latch` is the `Awaiting` state with a user-specified number of latches 
remaining.

The `release` method atomically modifies the state based on its current value:
if the current state is `Counting` and there is more than one latch remaining, 
then subtract by one, but if there is only one latch left, then transition to 
the `Done` state and unblock all the waiters. If the current state is `Done`, 
then do nothing.

The `await` method inspects the current state; if it is `Done`, then allow the
current fiber to pass through, otherwise, block the current fiber with the 
`waiter`.

```tut:silent
object Latch {
  def apply(latches: Int): IO[Latch] =
    for {
      waiter <- IO.deferred[Unit]
      state <- IO.ref[State](Awaiting(latches, waiter))
    } yield new Latch {
      override def release: IO[Unit] = 
        state.modify {
          case Awaiting(n, waiter) => 
            if (n > 1)
              (Awaiting(n - 1, waiter), IO.unit)
            else
              (Done, waiter.complete(()))
          case Done => (Done, IO.unit)
        }.flatten.void
      override def await: IO[Unit] = 
        state.get.flatMap {
          case Done => IO.unit
          case Awaiting(_, waiter) => waiter.get
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, we can use our new concurrent data type in a runnable example:

```tut:silent
object ExampleSix extends IOApp.Simple {
  override def run: IO[Unit] =
    for {
      latch <- Latch(10)
      _ <- (1 to 10).toList.traverse { idx => 
        (IO.println(s"$idx counting down") *> latch.release).start
      }
      _ <- latch.await
      _ <- IO.println("Got past the latch")
    } yield ()
}
```

This program creates a `Latch` with 10 internal latches and spawns 10 fibers, 
each of which releases one internal latch. The main fiber awaits against the 
`Latch`. Once all 10 fibers have released a latch, the main fiber is unblocked 
and can proceed. The output of the program should resemble the following:

```
1 counting down
3 counting down
6 counting down
2 counting down
8 counting down
9 counting down
10 counting down
4 counting down
5 counting down
7 counting down
Got past the latch
```

Notice how the latch serves as a form of synchronization that influences the
ordering of effects among the fibers; the main fiber will never proceed until
after the `Latch` is completely released.

### Scheduling
We've talked about fibers as a conceptual model with which Cats Effect
implements concurrency. One aspect of this that we haven't addressed is: how do
fibers actually execute? Our Scala applications ultimately run on the JVM (or a 
JavaScript runtime if we're using Scala.js), so fibers must ultimately be 
mapped to native threads in order for them to actually run. The scheduler is
responsible for determining how this mapping takes place.

On the JVM, Cats Effect uses an M:N scheduling model to map fibers to threads.
In practice, this means that a large number of fibers is multiplexed onto 
much smaller pools of native threads. A typical application will reserve a 
fixed-size pool for CPU-bound tasks, an unbounded pool for blocking tasks,
and several event handler pools for asynchronous tasks. Throughout its 
lifetime, a fiber will migrate between these pools to accomplish its various
tasks. In JavaScript runtimes, a M:1 scheduling model is employed, where all 
active fibers are scheduled onto a single native thread for execution.

Another aspect of scheduling is how context switching of fibers takes place,
which has many implications around the fairness and throughput properties of a
concurrent application. Like many other lightweight thread runtimes, Cats 
Effect's default scheduler exhibits cooperative multitasking in which fibers 
can explicitly "yield" back to the scheduler, allowing a waiting fiber to run. 
The yielded fiber will be scheduled to resume execution at some later time.
This is achieved with the `IO.cede` function. 

Cats Effect's default scheduler also supports autoyielding which is a form of 
preemptive multitasking. As we mentioned earlier, logical threads are composed
of a possibly infinite sequence of actions. Autoyielding "preempts" or forcibly
yields a fiber after it runs a certain number of actions, enabling waiting 
fibers to proceed. This is particularly important on runtimes that run with 1
or 2 native threads; a fiber that runs forever but never `cede`s will starve
other fibers of compute time.

### Parallelism
One aspect of multithreaded programming that we have neglected to mention so 
far is parallelism. In theory, parallelism is completely independent of 
concurrency; parallelism is about simultaneous execution whereas concurrency 
is about interleaved execution. 

Parallelism is typically achieved by exploiting multiple CPU cores or even 
multiple, independent machines to run a set of tasks much faster than they 
would run on a single CPU or machine. Parallelism is also not necessarily
nondeterministic; we can run a set of deterministic tasks in parallel multiple
times and expect to get back the same result every time. For our purposes, 
parallelism can be paired with concurrency to speed up the execution of many 
logical threads. This is exactly what JVMs already do: multiple native threads 
run simultaneously, resulting in higher throughput of tasks.

An obscure but crucial point here is that concurrency can be achieved without
parallelism; this is called single-threaded concurrency. We've already seen an 
example of this: JavaScript runtimes run on a single compute thread, so the 
execution of all fibers must take place on that thread as well!

### Exercises

1. Why is the low-level fiber API designated as unsafe? Hint: consider how the
fiber API interacts with cancellation.
2. Implement `timeout` in terms of `IO.both`. `timeout` runs some action for up
to a specified duration, after which it throws an errors.
```scala
def timeout[A](io: IO[A], duration: FiniteDuration): IO[A]
```
2. Implement `parTraverse` in terms of `IO.both`. `parTraverse` is the same as
`traverse` except all `IO[B]` are run in parallel.
```scala
def parTraverse[A](as: List[A])(f: A => IO[B]): IO[List[B]]
```
3. Implement `Semaphore` in terms of `Ref` and `Deferred`.
```scala
trait Semaphore {
  def acquire: IO[Unit]
  def release: IO[Unit]
}
object Semaphore {
  def apply(permits: Int): IO[Semaphore]
}
```
4. Implement `Queue` in terms of `Ref` and `Deferred`.
```scala
trait Queue[A] {
  def put(a: A): IO[Unit]
  def tryPut(a: A): IO[Boolean]
  def take: IO[A]
  def tryTake: IO[Option[A]]
  def peek: IO[Option[A]]
}
object Queue {
  def apply[A](length: Int): IO[Queue[A]]
}
```
5. `Stateful` is a typeclass in Cats MTL that characterizes a monad's ability 
to access and manipulate state. This is typically used in monad transformer 
stacks in conjunction with the `StateT` transformer. Is it possible to create 
a `Stateful` instance given a `Ref`?
